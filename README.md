![beetlejuice](./images/beetle-juice.jpeg)

Usage:
```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/justinbather/beetlejuice.git
# cd into
cd beetlejuice

# for this to work properly you need to create a discord application/bot and invite them to your
# server

# setup openai api key and load $5

# from beetlejuice/
touch .env

# copy env variable names from config/.env.sample into your .env as well as your api keys

npm start

# now you just mention the bot in your server and get roasted :)
```
